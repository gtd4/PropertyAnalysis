# PropertyAnalysis
This project is for analysing properties from Tradme.co.nz to try and help make better choices for property investments.

The goal is to firstly view properties from trademe and see what kind of rent we would need to charge to achieve a certain yield.

ToDo:
1) Easily find properties whose asking prices are below the recorded Rateable Value
2) Rank Properties based on certain criteria (Cost, Cheaper than RV, how long a unit has been on the market and others)
3) Be able to compare up to 3 properties at the same time
